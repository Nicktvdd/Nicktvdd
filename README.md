🌍 Combating Climate Change<br>
Beyond coding, I'm passionate about sustainable development and combating climate change. My vision is to leverage technology as a powerful tool to contribute positively to the environment and raise awareness about pressing environmental issues.

🎓 Goals and Aspirations<br>
As a student at Hive Helsinki, I'm determined to expand my programming skills and explore green technologies that promote eco-friendly practices. I aspire to develop software solutions that make a meaningful impact in the fight against climate change, while also collaborating with like-minded individuals to drive positive change.

🌱 Hobbies and Interests<br>
In addition to my programming endeavors, I hold a background in Sport Science that nurtures my love for physical well-being and active living. During my leisure time, you can often find me engrossed in the captivating realms of fantasy books or embarking on thrilling Dungeons & Dragons quests with my friends. As I delve into coding sessions, metal music keesp me in the zone. I cherish every moment spent on nature walks with my beloved wife and doggien. Exploring the beauty of the great outdoors not only rejuvenates my mind but also reinforces my commitment to sustainability and environmental awareness.
